                        <h3>WOOLWORTHS</h3>
							<p>Woolworths sells a wide range of products including food, clothing, beauty, homeware and more under its own label.</p>
                    
                            <p>The first Woolworths store opened its doors to the public in Cape Town in October 1931. And it was founder Max Sonnenberg who captured the public’s imagination with dynamic store policies that set Woolworths apart from its competitors.</p>
                    
                            <p>Three years later, a second branch opened in Durban, with another two in Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg a year later. And since then we’ve been building on our reputation for superior quality, exciting innovation and excellent value.</p>
								
							<p>Store Number: G6</p>
